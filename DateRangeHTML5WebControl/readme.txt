The tt-datarange-template.html is copied to the solution directory where it is installed in to bower.
The package is registered as: 

bower register tt-daterange https://github.com/TalalTayyab/DateRangeHTML5WebControl.git

If you update the tt-daterange-template.html file, build the project so the latest version is copied in the solution directory (one level up).
